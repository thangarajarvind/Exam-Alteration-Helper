# Exam Alteration Helper

This project  involves the creation of a platform
which the faculties of educational institutions can utilize to streamline their schedule through
the use of multiple modules such as one for viewing their schedule and another for updating
their details. All of the above modules are accessible through the use of credentials unique to
each faculty that directs them to their respective dashboards. The page also has a separate
dashboard that is unique to the site administrator(admin) where they can control each and
every activity and update faculty timetables. They can also view the status of all the faculty
and can assign exam duty to them in case there is some clash with other faculty.
