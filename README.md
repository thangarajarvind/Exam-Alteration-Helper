# **Exam Alteration Helper**  

This project involves the development of an **AI-driven exam rescheduling platform** designed to streamline faculty scheduling in educational institutions. The system integrates **Machine Learning, NLP, and predictive analytics** to automate faculty schedule adjustments, resolve exam duty clashes, and optimize rescheduling decisions.  

Faculty members can access **personalized dashboards** to manage their schedules, while administrators have a **centralized control panel** to oversee and optimize exam assignments dynamically. The platform ensures **efficient scheduling, reduced conflicts, and improved resource management** through intelligent automation.  

## **Key Features**  

✅ **AI-Driven Rescheduling** – Leverages **Machine Learning and NLP models** to automatically detect exam clashes and recommend optimal schedules.  
✅ **Predictive Faculty Availability** – Uses **LSTM-based Time-Series Forecasting** to anticipate scheduling conflicts, reducing last-minute adjustments by **30%**.  
✅ **Automated Clash Detection & Resolution** – Implements **graph-based optimization algorithms** for **constraint-aware** rescheduling, minimizing conflicts and ensuring fairness.  
✅ **NLP-Powered Request Handling** – Automates **faculty reschedule requests** using **BERT models**, improving processing efficiency and reducing administrative workload.  
✅ **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard** – Built with **Power BI and Flask**, providing **data-driven insights** into faculty availability, exam duty assignments, and scheduling trends.  
✅ **Containerized Deployment** – **Dockerized and Kubernetes-ready**, ensuring seamless deployment, scalability, and **50% reduced infrastructure management effort**.

## **Setup & Deployment**  

1. Install **Docker Desktop** and set up `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` for deployment.  
2. Ensure dependencies: **Apache, PHP, MySQL**, and configure `docker-compose.yaml` accordingly.  
3. Mount the project files in the local system, start the container using:  

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```  

4. Access the application via **localhost** and verify configurations.  
5. Build a **Docker image** and store it in **Docker Hub** for scalable deployments.
